# 🚲 Bike Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project analyzes bike purchasing patterns to identify key factors that influence a customer's decision to buy a bike. Using Excel, I created an interactive dashboard that visualizes relationships between customer demographics, lifestyle factors, and bike purchases.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on approximately 1000 individuals from diverse backgrounds, including:
- Demographic information (age, gender, marital status)
- Income levels
- Number of children
- Education and occupation
- Home ownership status
- Commuting patterns
- Geographic region
- Bike purchase decision (Yes/No)

## Project Workflow

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

1. Created a working copy of the original data to preserve the raw dataset
2. Removed duplicates and standardized entries
3. Replaced abbreviations with full terms (e.g., 'M' with 'Married', 'F' with 'Female')
4. Created a custom "Age Brackets" column to categorize ages into Adolescent, Middle Age, and Old age groups
5. Formatted income values as currency

### Data Analysis

Created pivot tables to analyze:
- Average income differences between bike purchasers and non-purchasers by gender
- Bike purchase patterns across different commute distances
- Age group distribution of customers who purchased bikes

### Dashboard Creation

Developed an interactive dashboard with:
- Slicers for filtering by marital status, region, and education level
- Visualizations showing key insights:
  - Average income per purchase by gender
  - Customer age bracket distribution
  - Customer commute distance patterns

## Key Insights

1. **Income Impact**: Customers with higher average income in their respective gender category were more likely to purchase bikes. Male purchasers had an average income of approximately $60,000, while female purchasers averaged around $55,000[3][4].

2. **Age Demographics**: Middle age customers (31-54 years) were significantly more likely to purchase bikes compared to adolescent and older age groups[5].

3. **Commute Distance**: An inverse relationship exists between commute distance and bike purchases. People with shorter commutes (0-1 miles) were most likely to purchase bikes, while those with commutes over 10 miles were least likely to buy[5].

4. **Regional Variations**: Purchasing patterns varied by geographic region, with some regions showing stronger bike purchase tendencies[6].

5. **Education Influence**: Education level appeared to correlate with purchasing decisions, with higher educated individuals showing different purchasing patterns[6].

## How to Use the Dashboard

1. Open the Excel file in Microsoft Excel
2. Navigate to the "Dashboard" sheet
3. Use the slicers on the left to filter data by:
   - Marital Status (Married/Single)
   - Region (Europe/North America/Pacific)
   - Education level
4. Observe how the charts update to reflect your selections

## Technologies Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Excel PivotTables and PivotCharts
- Excel Slicers for interactive filtering
- Conditional formatting
- Excel charting tools

## Future Improvements

- Add additional demographic analysis
- Include time-based purchasing patterns if data becomes available
- Expand analysis to include profitability metrics
- Incorporate product category preferences
